iBoola us a waste management system that connects stakeholders in the waste management sector and compensates them for  participation.

iBoola smart waste bin enables tokenization of agricultural/market waste. It operates using technologies like Blockchain, Internet of Things(IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Geographical information system (GPS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) + Radio-frequency identification (RFID).  

The bin connects disposers with collectors who send waste to processing units where it will be processed into organic fertilizer and clean energy.

Our objectives are simply;
- Wealth creation
- Effective waste management
- Reduction in the use of synthetic fertilizer
- Clean energy

We intend to implement our idea by sensitizing the locals on waste management and environmental health, while presenting an opportunity to be compensated for participating in cleaning our environment.

The smart bins will be sited in strategic locations where it will be put to maximum use and contributors will be compensated for participating. 
Compensation rate:
Contributors - 10%
Collector - 65%
iBoola - 25%

With this, we hope to create a regenerative ecosystem for our farmers and market communities, clean our environment and generate a substantial amount of clean energy.

This idea can be implemented in various capacities ranging from farm to open market, superstores to restaurants, it can also be used in offices and individual homes. 

We intend to start with farms and markets where we have huge amounts of waste while we gradually warm up to other areas of our everyday lives where waste is generated.

Once we successfully manage the growth in a few locations, we will upscale and add possible models that will suit offices and home use.
